# World Cup Oracle — verified sports data, settled on Solana

> An **LLM agent** that sells a **verified TxODDS World Cup edge** — live, de-margined odds turned into
> a one-line value call — and settles every delivery **trustlessly through a Solana escrow contract**.
> Reason · deliver · settle on-chain.

The agent fetches verified de-margined World Cup odds on **devnet**, turns them into a one-line value
call with confidence, and on delivery the buyer escrow **settles automatically** — a real
deposit→release you can open on the Solana Explorer. Everything runs on devnet: free play money, real
on-chain settlement. A forkable React dashboard renders the live board.

## The three pillars

Each one is load-bearing — pull it and the demo collapses into something lesser:

| Pillar | Its job | Remove it → |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Verified data (TxODDS)** | the proxy subscribes a devnet wallet to the free World Cup tier and fetches live, de-margined 1X2 odds | unverifiable numbers |
| **LLM** | turns the verified odds into a one-line value call + confidence — the sellable product | a static odds board |
| **Solana escrow** | a `reference` binds the deal; on delivery the buyer deposits and releases SOL to the seller (refundable after a deadline) | trust-me play money |

The product is the [`analyzeEdge()`](examples/txodds/agent/edge.ts) transform — verified odds → an LLM
call — shared between the proxy and the agent. That, and [`deliverService()`](examples/txodds/agent/service.ts),
are where you'd add your own.

## Prerequisites

Everything runs on **devnet** — free play money, real on-chain settlement. Keys live in a local `.env` (none in the repo). **No Docker required.**

| Need | Why | Get it |
|------|-----|--------|
| **Node 20+** | the proxy + web UI + runtime | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| **An LLM key** | the agent's value call | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (default) — or `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| **A funded devnet wallet** | the buyer signs the escrow deposit→release | generated in step 1; fund at [faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com) |

> The demo still renders without a key or funding — it shows clearly-labelled demo data and skips the
> on-chain settle. A funded wallet + LLM key turn on **live odds** and **real settlement**.

## Quick start

### 1. Set up (once)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/trilltino/solana_coralOS.git && cd solana_coralOS
npm install --prefix scripts   # script deps (web3.js, bs58)
node scripts/setup.js          # creates .env + two devnet wallets (also saved to WALLETS.txt)
```

Open the generated `.env`, add your LLM key, then **fund the buyer wallet** at
[faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com) (GitHub sign-in — the only devnet faucet that works):

```ini
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…     # the agent's brain
# …or flip to OpenAI (no code change):
# LLM_PROVIDER=openai
# OPENAI_API_KEY=…
```

Re-running `setup.js` re-reads your `.env`, so it never clobbers the key you just added.

### 2. Run it

```sh
npm run dev        # = node scripts/txodds.js
```

This starts the **proxy** (live TxODDS data + escrow settlement, port 8801) and the **Oracle UI**
(port 3020), and opens the browser. Select a fixture and you'll see:

1. the **verified de-margined 1X2 board** (live World Cup odds),
2. the **agent's call** — the LLM's one-line value pick + confidence,
3. the **buyer escrow settling automatically** on delivery — deposit ↗ · release ↗ · escrow PDA ↗,
   linked on the Solana Explorer.

The board only ever shows fixtures with **verified live odds** (`/api/board`); it never invents
numbers. Without live data it falls back to a clearly-labelled demo board.

## How it works

`npm run dev` runs two processes (both under [`scripts/txodds.js`](scripts/txodds.js)):

- **[`server/proxy.ts`](examples/txodds/server/proxy.ts)** (:8801) — the browser can't hold the TxLINE
  token or sign Solana transactions, so this Node server does both: it subscribes the buyer wallet to
  the free World Cup tier on devnet, then serves live fixtures/odds and, on delivery, runs a real
  escrow `deposit → release`. Endpoints: `/api/board` (fixtures with verified 1X2 odds, inlined),
  `/api/edge` (the agent's call), `/api/settle` (the escrow round).
- **[`web/`](examples/txodds/web)** (:3020) — a no-build React app rendering the board, the agent's
  call, and the settlement links.

## Under the hood — the runtime

The agent imports [`packages/agent-runtime`](packages/agent-runtime) and writes only behaviour. Four
modules, one per concern:

- **`llm/`** — [`complete()`](packages/agent-runtime/src/llm/complete.ts), one provider-agnostic call
  over `fetch` (no SDK). Anthropic by default; `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` flips it with no code change. The
  model **proposes**, code **disposes** — callers guard every number.
- **`solana/`** — Solana Pay helpers + [`solanaConnection()`](packages/agent-runtime/src/solana/connection.ts),
  the **devnet guard** that throws on a mainnet RPC unless `ALLOW_MAINNET=1`, so it applies everywhere
  value moves.
- **`coral/`** + **`market/`** — a CoralOS (MCP) client and the WANT/BID/AWARD market protocol. Not
  used by this single-agent oracle, but the rails are there if you grow it into a multi-agent market.

### The escrow contract — the settlement spine

The only Rust in the kit: a per-order escrow program
([`lib.rs`](examples/txodds/escrow/programs/escrow/src/lib.rs)), deployed to devnet and **called** (not
forked) by the agent's TS client — which fetches the IDL **on-chain**, so the demo needs only the
deployed program, not a local build.

| Instruction | Does |
|-------------|------|
| `initialize(amount, reference, deadline)` | buyer deposits SOL into a PDA seeded by `(buyer, reference)` |
| `release()` | buyer confirms delivery → pays the seller, closes the account, rent back to buyer |
| `refund()` | buyer reclaims the deposit after the deadline if the seller never delivered |

It's written to the Solana security checklist: `init` (never `init_if_needed`), `has_one` on **both**
buyer and seller, `close = buyer`, and checked math on every lamport move. **Devnet only** — never put
a funded mainnet key in `.env`; the guard above is the backstop. See
[`examples/txodds/escrow/README.md`](examples/txodds/escrow/README.md).

## Repo layout

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `examples/txodds/` | the World Cup Oracle — `agent/` (the edge transform + escrow client), `server/` (proxy + mint), `web/` (React app), `escrow/` (the Anchor contract) |
| `packages/agent-runtime/` | the runtime — `llm/`, `solana/`, `coral/`, `market/` |
| `scripts/` | `txodds.js` (`npm run dev`), `setup.js` (devnet wallets) |
